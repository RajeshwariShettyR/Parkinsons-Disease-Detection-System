            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify">
                Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a long-term, progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects movement. It occurs due to the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in a region of the brain called the <em>substantia nigra</em>. Dopamine is crucial for regulating the body’s motor functions, and its loss leads to difficulties in movement, coordination, and balance.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4 text-justify">
                Named after Dr. James Parkinson, who first identified it in 1817, the condition has become one of the most researched neurological disorders. While often associated with aging, Parkinson's can also affect younger individuals in a condition known as early-onset Parkinson’s.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                The exact cause of Parkinson’s Disease is not fully understood. Researchers believe it results from a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.

                <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Some gene mutations have been linked to Parkinson's, particularly in familial cases.</li>
                <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Exposure to toxins, such as pesticides or heavy metals, may increase risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Cellular Changes:</strong> Abnormal protein deposits called <em>Lewy bodies</em> are often found in the brains of those with Parkinson’s, but their role is not fully understood.</li>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify">
                Parkinson's Disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting over 10 million people worldwide. Its progressive nature impacts not only motor functions but also non-motor aspects such as emotional health, cognitive abilities, and autonomic functions.  
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4 text-justify">
                Living with Parkinson’s poses challenges for patients and caregivers alike. Despite its complexity, advancements in research, awareness campaigns, and community support have significantly improved the lives of those affected.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Scientific research into Parkinson's Disease continues to uncover new insights into its causes and progression. Promising studies focus on therapies that could slow the disease’s progression, restore dopamine levels, or even prevent the condition entirely.  
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                With the growing involvement of organizations, patients, and caregivers, the future holds hope for better management and, ultimately, a cure for Parkinson’s Disease.
